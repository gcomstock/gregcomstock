Once the next display ad iframe has fired its onload event, we can perform an elegant cross-fade between ads, and remove the old one from the DOM once its fadeout animation ends. This design decision ensures a display ad is always visible, because no impression time is spent waiting for ad assets to load. The result has been about a 15% increase in display ad capacity without impacting the user experience.

Once the next display ad iframe has fired its onload event, we can perform an elegant cross-fade between ads, and remove the old one from the DOM once its fadeout animation ends. This design decision ensures a display ad is always visible, because no impression time is spent waiting for ad assets to load. The result has been about a 15% increase in display ad capacity without impacting the user experience.
